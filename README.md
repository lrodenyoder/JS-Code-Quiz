## Description

This project is designed to be a quiz over basic JavaScript questions. It is a timed quiz that provides feedback on if the user answered the question correctly, incorrectly or need to choose an option. If the timer runs out, the game ends. If all questions are answered, the time remaining is the score and can be saved.
